A simple shortcut to open MBnet sidebar on the Android browser.

MBnet is an utility for people that have accounts on Portuguese banks. If you don't have one... this is useless to you.

This application or author has no affiliation with MBnet.

I just made this because I felt the need for an easier way to access MBnet on Android. Unfortunately there is no official application (yet)... hoping to see one soon and deprecate this one!

The source code is available for anyone to see!
